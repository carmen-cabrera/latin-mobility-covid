The evolution of the levels of movement was measured with respect to a baseline period prior to the pandemic as described in @sec-methods. For the purposes of the analysis, we aggregate the raw movement data temporally into months and spatially into administrative units according to various GADM levels.
The analysis focuses on administrative areas that are within the boundaries of functional urban areas as specified by the Global Human Settlement Layer.
For each administrative area, we compute the Relative Deprivation Index based on data from NASA's Socioeconomic Data and Applications Centre (SEDAC). Further details are given in @sec-methods.
